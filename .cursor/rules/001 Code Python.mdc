## python-usage
- Always write modular code with functions and classes when necessary.
- Avoid global variables.
- Use descriptive variable and function names (e.g., `load_data`, `is_valid`, `has_permission`).
- Use type annotations and type hints (`mypy` compatible).
- Keep functions short and focused on a single responsibility.
